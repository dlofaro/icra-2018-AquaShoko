In conclusion we have created a multi-legged robot that is IP-68 rated at 3$m$ which is specifically designed for our overarching goal of creating a system that can operate underwater in low signature environments while keeping visibility, mobility, and dexterity.
This initial prototype has been tested using multiple types of mathematical analyses including FEA and physical testing including the use of a pressure chambers for simulated at depth conditions.
A dynamic simulation of the robot has been created in Gazebo and is controllable via its OpenSource controller called \textit{Shoko-Ach}.
Additionally the robot was designed to be able to move its center of buoyancy by moving its legs.
A controller has been designed for this robot to allow it to be thrown in the water at any angle and use its legs to ensure it lands on its feet.
Implementing the latter is immediate future work for this project.
