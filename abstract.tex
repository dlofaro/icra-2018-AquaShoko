When operating a submerged vehicle near the sea floor one of the primary sensors that are used are the cameras.
These cameras become obstructed by silt and other debris when the ground is disturbed by the thrust from the submerged vehicles screws/thrusters.
In many cases these visual sensors become useless in these conditions.
This paper shows works towards creating a robot that can operate near the sea floor while keeping the area silt/debris free and viewable.
Specifically, this paper shows the design of a multi-legged robot with long thin legs to reduces disturbances and vortexes caused by the robot's motion underwater.
Within the design is the ability to land on its feet by being able to move its center of buoyancy during decent from the surface to the sea floor.
Control methods for achieving this are also included.
All design choices, FEA, load analysis, and other pertinent specification requirements are also included.
The result of this work is the design, fabrication, and creation of the IP-68 at 3 meters rated quadruped that has a tip to tip leg span of more than two meters.
